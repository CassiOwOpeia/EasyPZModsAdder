# EasyPZModsAdder
Help you to add mods on your PZ server !

Click on "Open Mods & IDs Extraction" to open a new window where you can put your settings (you can put the entire settings, the software will take care of extracting mods and ids).
Once you are satisfied, you can click on "Output Mods & IDs" to transform the list of mods and ids into one line that correspond to the line you have to modified in your settings. You can hit CTRL+F and search Mods= or WorkshopItems= in your settings and paste the output.
"Add Mod" allows you to add a mod, first you will be asked to indicate the Mod ID, then the Workshop ID of the mod. You can also edit directly by hand the text.
"Add Mod by URL" allows you to put a steam url and will automatically add the mod, but be careful of mods that require other mods!!
"Keep only ID from Steam URL" allows you to copy paste a steam URL in the "Output Workshop IDs" and will remove automatically the begging of the URL to only keep the ID.
"Clear Mods" & "Clear IDs" allow you to turn the respectively output to blank.
